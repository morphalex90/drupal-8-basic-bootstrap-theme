# Drupal 8 Basic theme, Bootstrap based

This theme has been based on the current Bootstrap 3 official Drupal theme, but instead of loading the whole Bootstrap css, only the basic Bootstrap 4 structure for row, container, container flud and col(s) has been added.
Plus, the theme is not render blocking (see html.html.twig and render-blocking.js)
